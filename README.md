# demo-dashboards
A collection of dashboard and visualization demos containing fully reproducible demos with publicly available datasets

## Nitpicky details

Each demo should have it's own folder containing a `README.md` with lots of details on the subject matter of the demo, the packages used, how its meant to be served, etc. The folder should also contain an `environment.yml` and a conda-lock file.
